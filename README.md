# 77-MORKTOBER-2024
This is an expansion set for [7:7 A Dying Card Game](https://nacnudllah.itch.io/77-a-dying-card-game)

My itch.io page https://tech66.itch.io/morktober-2024-expansion

This is for [MÖRKTOBER 2024](https://www.exeunt.press/morktober) to make something for [MÖRK BORG](https://morkborg.com/) inspired by a  prompt list

I'm using these awesome tools:
  -  [CardMaker](https://github.com/nhmkdev/cardmaker) for the card layout/construction.
  -  [Paint.net](https://www.getpaint.net/) for image editing.
  -  [FastStone Image Viewer](https://www.faststone.org/) for iamge management.
  -  [PDF24](https://www.pdf24.org/) for pdf editing.

The base card Templates are by [Bruno](https://prosaiko.itch.io/7-7-card-template) which I have made some alterations to accomade text or card details.
